# Govt. Web Crawler â€“ Automated Index2 Document Downloader

## Objective
This project automates the process of downloading multiple **Index2** documents from the Maharashtra government website [igrmaharashtra.gov.in](https://igrmaharashtra.gov.in). These documents are crucial for data extraction and analysis, and manually downloading them is time-consuming. This website simplifies the process by automating the document retrieval based on user inputs.

- **Organized Storage**: Saves documents systematically for easy access.
- **Future Expansion**: Ready for integration with data extraction and analysis in the next phase.

## Tech Stack
| Component       | Technology Used                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**    | HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React/Vanilla JS)           |

## How It Works

### 1. User Inputs Details
- The website provides a form where users input details like **district, taluka, village, document number, and year**.
- Users can request bulk downloads for an entire year.

### 2. Automation Fetches Documents
- The backend scrapes the Maharashtra government website and downloads Index2 documents.
- The documents are stored systematically for easy retrieval.

### 3. Organized Storage
- The documents are saved in a structured format.
- Future updates will include data extraction and analysis.
